PyUserInput
===========

A module for cross-platform control of the mouse and keyboard in python that is simple to use.

Mouse control should work well for most users on Windows, Mac, and X11 (most linux) systems.

Keyboard control only works for X11 systems and is under active development. Testing and bug
reports are highly desired.
