PyUserInput
===========

A module for cross-platform control of the mouse and keyboard in python that is simple to use.

Mouse control should work well for most users on Windows, Mac, and X11 (most linux) systems.

Keyboard control works on X11(linux) and Windows systems. Mac control has not yet been coded. Keyboard event handling in Windows is coming soon.
